<h1>Overview</h1>
<div class="cols2">
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="https://i.imgur.com/y9VAH7k.jpg">world map</a> is from Divine Right. Each hex is 50 miles. The campaign starts in Muetar (yellow), in the city of Basimar.</li>
	<li>Drop fractions unless stated otherwise.</li>
	<li>The silver coin (s.c.) is the standard currency. A gold coin is a big deal to the average person. Imagine a silver coin is USD $10 and a gold coin is USD $100, roughly.</li>
	<li>To-hit bonuses are +1 per level for fighters, +1/2 per level for Magic-Users, and +2/3rds per level for everyone else.</li>
	<li>Many of the classes are a little bit different. See the class pages below.</li>
	<li>You can get class feats at levels 1, 4, 8, and 12. These are considered exceptional; not every 1st level fighter will have a feat.</li>
	<li>Saving throws are Target 20: roll D20 plus modifiers and try to get 20+. The standard saves at level 0 are: <br><strong>Doom</strong> +5, <strong>Slice</strong> +4, <strong>Bind</strong> +3, <strong>Blast</strong> +2, and <strong>Hex</strong> +1.<br>These all go up by +1 every level/HD, including first.</li>
	<li>Hit points are rerolled every level, keeping higher total (or lower, if being level-drained).</li>
	<li>At 0 hit points you fall prone and must save vs. Doom or die. If you save, you are still incapacitated, on the ground, and will bleed out eventually. If tended to, you can get back to 1hp and mobility. In any case you are injured (half speed, half actions) until back at max HP.</li>
	<li>With a full night's rest, double your current HP, but regain only one spell slot.</li>
	<li>Weapons are different and have special rules based on size and type. See Weaponry below.</li>
	<li>Critical hits trigger on maximum damage rolls, and explode. Blunt weapons do not crit. Weapons 2+ sizes smaller than the target do not crit, unless they are piercing weapons. So a (VS) punch cannot crit a (M) human, but a (VS) knife can. Only things that would normally roll to hit crit on damage.</li>
	<li>Ranged attacks are -1 to-hit for every full 30' of range. Indoors most shots are direct fire. Outdoors, more arc can be used and maximum range is tripled. Shots generally are off-target by 1' per pip. Aiming at a specific spot in the ground is AC 10 (it's small, but it's not moving).</li>
	<li>Lamp oil does not burn well enough to be a weapon. Alchemists sell <i>alchemists fire</i> for 25 s.c.</li>
	<li>Equipment is quite different; see below.</li>
	<li>Item-based encumbrance. Each 'enc' is about 5 lbs.</li>
	<li>Upkeep cost is (Level^2 x 100) s.c. per month. This covers living expenses, taxes, money-handling fees, repairs and mending, storage, stabling fees, clothing, etc.</li>
</ul>

	<p><b>Turning Undead: </b>Each round, resolved before initiative, your Cleric may make an attempt to turn one type of undead by brandishing their holy symbol and uttering the Law against such abominations. Each type may only be attempted to be turned once per combat. The chance of a successful turn is <b>3-in-6 adjusted by the difference between the caster's level and the target's HD</b>. If the turn is successful, 2D6 HD worth of creatures (minimum 1 creature) are affected. They will attempt to flee, or, if the turn roll succeeded by 3+, they are destroyed immediately and utterly.
	<p><b>Spells:</b> Clerics prepare a spell into a spell slot by praying for 10 minutes. A night's rest restores 1 spell</p>
<br>

<p>Dwarves are created from stone-made-flesh by other dwarfs, and the cost of this process is handed onto dwarves as a debt.

	<p><b>Spellcasting</b>: MUs keep spellbooks and can have more spells than they memorize. MUs can memorize from spellbooks or scrolls (there is no difference between the two). Copying a scroll is difficult, requiring a day, (100 x Spell level) sc of materials, and a successful save vs. Hex. If the save is failed the effort is fruitless; if it is failed with a natural 1 the original spell is lost.</p>
<br>
<h3>Magic-User Feats</h3>
Foci must be crafted personally by an MU and cost a week of work, plus 100 sc of special material, x10 for each additional feat's ability supported. You can only have one focus.
<ul>
<li><i>Familiar</i>. You gain a familiar, a loyal and helpful 1HD creature. With a round of concentration you can sense through its senses instead of yours and communicate with it telepathically. If it dies you can attract another after a week.
<li><i>Split Mind</i>. You are ambidextrous, and you can cast two spells at once if both your hands are free.
<li><i>Orb Caster</i>. You need a focus to cast spells, but you can double the range or duration of spells you cast when you cast them.
<li><i>Wand Caster</i>. You need a focus to cast spells, but you can memorize +1 spell per level.
<li><i>Gem Caster</i>. You need a focus to cast spells, but you can store spells in your focus whose total levels are no greater than your level.
<li><i>Apt Pupil</i>. You make magic items at half cost and time, and never fail to copy spells successfully.
<li><i>Angelic Lore</i>. Per spell level you can cast, one random Cleric spell of that level is learnable as if it was an MU spell.
<li><i>Thaumaturge</i>. You can wield any weapon and wear any non-metallic armor.
<li><i>Spillover</i>. You can express cantrip-like manifestations of your currently memorized spells. They are pretty weak.
<li><i>Blood Caster</i>. After casting a spell you can maintain memory of it, but take 1D4 psychic damage per level of the spell.

<li><i>Faceless</i>. You are an almost perfect mimic of others voices and mannerisms and good at disguises.
<li><i>Rombunic Training</i>. You are immune to poisons personally, and can maintain Level/2 doses of poisons on you of various kinds (paralytics, deadly poisons, hypnotics). Larger targets require more doses, and they must be tailored to humanoids or to beasts. Doses spoil and can be recovered 1/week.
<li><i>All Skill</i>. Up to (Level/2) times per session you may reroll any D6 roll you rolled, including for surprise, initiative, etc.

<p><b>Soak</b>: Any shield can be used to remove a soak roll of damage from a melee or ranged attack the character is aware of. This can happen after the incoming damage is known. This diminishes the die and the shield breaks after going below 1d4. <b>Small shields</b> can be managed so that the user has the hand free (e.g. to cast spells, if an elf). <b>Quality</b> armor has a lower weight; quality shields have a higher soak die. <b>Bronze</b> and <b>small</b> armors are for elves and halflings.
